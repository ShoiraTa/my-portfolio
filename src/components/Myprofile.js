            <h2>A curiosity-driven Front-End Developer.</h2>
            <p>
              I&apos;m passionate about bringing both the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, beautiful pixels and writing clean accessible, human code matters to me. I sweat the details. And as a follower of John Maedaâ€™s Laws Of Simplicity, I agree that less is more. I am currently enrolled in a remote software development school. I have a number of projects developed using Javascript, React, Redux, and Rails.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have experience working as a front-end engineer in an IT company where I was developing and maintaining eCommerce websites on Shopify. I&apos;m currently strengthening my back-end and front-end development skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&apos;m happiest when I&apos;m creating, learning, exploring and thinking about how to make things better.
            </p>
